# Jarvis 2.0

**A local-first personal AI second brain**

Jarvis 2.0 is a modular personal assistant foundation for capturing, organizing, and retrieving information across personal and project workspaces. M01-A and M01-B are merged in `main`; M01-C lexical retrieval is being prepared on a feature branch.

> **Project status:** local SQLite storage and approved-folder ingestion are in `main`; M01-C workspace-scoped bilingual lexical search is under review. M01-C remains unmerged until its tests and Windows compatibility are verified. No semantic-search, AI, cloud, GUI, or voice capability is claimed.

## Product goals

- Windows desktop application and browser dashboard.
- Arabic and English interaction.
- Persistent memories linked to evidence and their source.
- Synchronization only from user-approved local folders.
- Explicit confirmation before a suggested fact becomes permanent memory.
- Personal and project workspaces with explicit approval for cross-workspace retrieval.
- Reversible memory deletion.
- Local Ollama inference with optional, user-configured cloud routing.
- Later voice, MCP/API, GitHub, OpenCode, browser automation, authorized reverse engineering, and multi-agent development workflows.
- Proactive suggestions that never execute without approval; any future Mission Mode must be bounded and separately approved.
- No required paid API or subscription.

## Repository status

The current `main` revision contains the M01-A SQLite storage and permissions foundation and M01-B approved-folder ingestion. M01-C is under review on its own feature branch. See the milestone-specific documents for implemented behavior and verification evidence.

## Development principles

1. Reuse maintained software where it fits; verify the exact version, dependency closure, license, and security posture before adoption.
2. Keep local-first operation and ordinary use free of mandatory paid services.
3. Make data location, evidence, workspace scope, retention, and deletion behavior understandable to the user.
4. Require explicit consent for permanent memories, cross-workspace retrieval, sensitive integrations, and consequential external actions.
5. Separate proposals from verified implementation. Do not report tests, integrations, or security properties that have not been checked.

## Review status

M01-C is the current review slice. M01-D or later work must wait for explicit approval after M01-C review. See [M01_SPEC.md](docs/M01_SPEC.md) and [M01-C Retrieval](docs/M01C_RETRIEVAL.md).
